File permissions are displayed  when running the ls -l command. Regular files are represented by a dash (-), a directory is represented by a d, and other symbols may represent special file types or permissions
Example: 

total 16
-rw-rw-r-- 1 temporal temporal 1806 set 28 16:01 01ip.log
-rw-rw-r-- 1 temporal temporal  309 set 28 16:02 02InstallVim.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 temporal temporal 1054 set 28 16:20 03Diskspace.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 temporal temporal  327 set 28 16:25 04Filesystem
-rw-rw-r-- 1 temporal temporal    0 set 28 16:27 05Listfiles
all of this start with a -, so al of this are files. 

The first tree represent owner permissions, the next tree group permissions and the last three represent others

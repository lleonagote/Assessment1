The logs are on the /var/log directory
To read the last 10 lines: tail <filename> 
To read the first 10 lines:head <filename>
Less: the less <filename> command displays the file like the man command, in pages with controls to scroll and move

the -n <number> can be added to the tail or head commands to se a specific number of lines, but by default those two commands show 10 lines.
